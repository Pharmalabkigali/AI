NOTICE
Analytical instruments for in vitro diagnostic application involve the handling of human samples and controls
which should be considered at least potentially infectious. Therefore every part and accessory of the respective
instrument which may have come into contact with such samples must equally be considered as potentially
infectious.
BIOHAZARD
The „BIOHAZARD“ warning label must be affixed to instrument prior to first use with biological material !
Servicing Note:
Before doing any servicing on the instrument it is very important to thoroughly disinfect all possibly contaminated
parts. Before the instrument is removed from the laboratory for disposal or servicing, it must be decontaminated.
Decontamination should be performed by authorised well-trained personnel only, observing all necessary safety
precautions. Instruments to be returned have to be accompanied by a decontamination certificate completed by
the responsible laboratory manager. If a decontamination certificate is not supplied, the returning laboratory will
be responsible for charges resulting from non-acceptance of the instrument by the servicing centre, or from
authority’s interventions.

2.1.1 Counting chamber with electrodes and measuring aperture
-
Impedance method is used for determination of volume and number of cells. In this method a known volume
of dilution is drawn through a small aperture. Constant current is passed through the aperture from one side to
the other. When a cell passes through the aperture, it causes a change in resistance, which generates a voltage
pulse. The amplitude of the voltage pulse is proportional to the ratio of cell volume per aperture volume. This is
used to determine the volume of cells. The number of cells can be obtained by counting the pulses.
-
In the instruments there are two cell-counter chambers: separate for RBC and WBC.
-
In the RBC chamber the instruments counts red blood cells, and uses no lyse at all in this chamber. It has a
smaller draining outlet made of plastic and its measuring tube contains an 80 μm-sized aperture.
-
In the WBC chamber the instrument counts all kind of WBC. It has a measuring tube with an aperture size of
100 μm and a bigger draining outlet made of PTFE (Teflon).
-
Both of the chambers have a reference electrode and a draining outlet. The picture shown below you can see
the chambers and the two kind of measuring tubes.
-
The aperture is made of ruby and it is molded into the measuring tube.

2.1.2 HGB Head
Hemoglobin head is placed around the WBC measuring chamber in the instrument.
It contains: a light source (LED) at 540 nm wavelength and Photo Detector (TSL235). The Photo Detector converts
the light to frequency. The HGB concentration is a logarithmic function of this frequency measured by the FPGA
circuit of the COMB card.
The analyzer performs enhanced Hemoglobin measurement technology for HGB measurement. The output of HGB
head is frequency (TSL235 detector is light to frequency converter). A digital counter in the FPGA circuit counts this
signal.
This counter counts up while the LED is on and counts down while the LED is off, the LED and the counter directions
are switched with a 250 Hz signal. This method provides “real time backlight correction”, which makes the HGB
measurement more precise in changing backlight environment situation as well.
There are two kinds of HGB measurements:
-
Sample measurement
(before RBC counting)
-
Diluent measurement
(in WBC washing phase)
The HGB result is calculated from these measurements by:
HGB # log (CNTdiluent light / CNTsample light)
Due to enhanced HGB technology, HUMACOUNT 5 is less sensitive to incident light changes. It is recommended to
keep side door closed during measurements.
2.1.3 Cell counter Amplifier Board
Amplifier board includes its own voltage regulators, connection interfaces to HGB head, to high voltage board and
to COMB. There is a current generator circuit on this board, which works from 50V measuring voltage (generated
by the High Voltage Board) and the probe voltage (DC) is amplified with a voltage follower (output: ELV). Nominal
measuring current is 870 μA.

Amplifier board includes one input connector for each measuring chamber (measuring electrode). There is one
opto switch (OPT1) and a relay (REL1) to connect high voltage to one of the probes with HSW signal and to isolate
the input of the amplifier. Test circuit allows generating test pulses (with TEST and PLS signals through Q1, Q2
FETs) for checking proper operation of each amplifier channel.
Amplifier board includes a 3-stage main amplifier channel, which gains input signal to the 0...5 V range (this is the
input range of the A/D converter (IC10), which is placed on the COMB card). The RSW signal (with Q8 transistor)
changes the input electrode through REL2 relay. There is an offset potentiometer, P1 in the third amplifier stage,
manufacturer sets the correct offset voltage.
Adjust the offset voltage only in case it is out of the +/- 5mV range.
The bottom side of the amplifier board contains special connectors for the electrodes and the HGB head (JP2).
DHON signal - from the COMB board - switches on (with Q4) the LED and the PLS signal switches off the Photo
Detector in the HGB head, to prevent noise generated by the HGB detector.

3 CONTROL AND MEASUREMENT BOARD (COMB) WITH DIMMPC CORE
The compact COMB incorporates a single PC and its environmental functions, as well as the specific measurement
processing functions in one board.
PC system of the COMB board is based on the DimmPC module, which is a credit card size PC with a 133 MHz
Pentium-class core. The DimmPC itself contains 32Mbyte RAM and same size of Flash disk that acts like a hard disk.
DimmPC module is easily replaceable as it has an open socket (and an additional screw for safe fixing). COMB card
contains some drivers/protection-circuits for the interfaces such as LPT, COM1, PS2, USB, IDE, Floppy and Speaker.
Measurement processing is based on FPGA (IC5) circuit. After power on, FPGA holds the DimmPC in wait state (with
–IOCHRDY signal) until the microcontroller (IC8) configures the FPGA circuit from the IDEPROM (status LED is red
during configuration). After that the FPGA controls the entire pneumatic system through the Pneumatic I2C bus,
the Keyboard and Display module with video RAM (IC6) for MDA (Monochrome Display Adapter) emulation, and
Start button & status LED. FPGA circuit also performs measurement data acquisition by using the 10-bit A/D chip
(IC10). FPGA makes digital data processing and stores the results in the internal FIFO memory. Cell parameters are
sent to the DimmPC by single DMA cycles.

'LPP3&0RGXOH
The COMB board incorporates a credit-card size PC, called DimmPC*. The processor on the DimmPC is a 133MHz
Pentium-class core, with 32Mbytes on-board RAM, and 32 Mbytes on-board IDE compatible Flash Disk. This is the
HDD (hard disk drive) of the analyzer, so instrument software with all user settings, calibration, database, etc. is
stored on the DimmPC.

HUMACOUNT 5 has a bit more complexity (e.g. more valves, tubes, etc.) than the previous HUMACOUNT members.
This fact and the differences in the operation results that the internal temperature of the instrument is bit higher.
Providing the safe operating conditions for DimmPC we created a small fan assembly especially for HUMACOUNT
5.
The fan is controlled by the FPGA on the Control and Measurement Board through the Digital I/O ribbon cable
which connects the COMB and the amplifier. The Fan&Door board is assembled directly to this cable, it is an
integral part of the digital I/O cable.
NOTE: the fan is always on after the instrument has started EXCEPT during the measurement cycles protecting
them from noise.
3.1.2 Configuration and ID-EPROM board
This board provides interconnection between COMB and PPB cards: Pneumatic I2C bus, power lines and internal
printer signals are connected through this card. The board also contains a 24FC256 serial E2PROM, which stores the
configuration data of the FPGA and identity information of the instrument (Serial Number, OEM, model, etc.).
Keeping the hardware identity information (write-protected), IDEPROM makes possible to run the correct software.

3.1.3 Pneumatic and Power Board (PPB)
PPB card contains the main power regulator circuits, valve and motor driver circuits and other connections for the
fluidic and pneumatic system’s parts.
Power system generates +5V (Digital power), +8V (Printer power) and +12V (Motor and valve power) from the
single +12V DC input signal.
Motor driver part consists of six separated PIC micro-controllers with power drivers. Horizontal, Vertical and
Sample rotor motors have one combined ribbon cable connection. Main Dilutor (with two motors) and Micro-
dilutor have separated connectors.
Valve driver section is based on the valve driver PIC micro-controller and three 8-bit, powered output shift registers
(with built in protection diodes) and there are two common ribbon cable connections for the 4 valve boards. The
peristaltic pump has a separated Darlington driver circuit for more reliable operation.
All the 7 (6 for motors, 1 for pneumatic) microcontrollers have 2 LEDs: a yellow one and a green one.
The yellow one indicates motor moving or holding and active valve or pump moving, (it means current flows into
motors, valves or pump).
The green one has 3 states:
-
dark: (after initialization phase) error state,

3.1.4 Opto-boards for stepper motors
There are six stepper motors in the system: Horizontal and Vertical motors, which make the movements of the
sampling needle; the main Dilutor motors (2), which move the syringes (DIL, Lyse, BAS, EOS); the Micro Dilutor
motor, which drives the sampling phase and the Sample Rotor. The stepper motor opto boards make the
connections between the motor driver ICs and motors, and have opto switches for the motor’s home and end
positions (exception: Sample Rotor Unit has 2 micro switches instead of optos). The actual status of the stepper
motor’s optos is indicated by two LEDs on each stepper motor opto boards.
Dilutor and Micro-dilutor have its own separated opto-board, located directly in the units.
Horizontal and Vertical motors and the sample rotor unit have a common Opto-board, called XYROpto Board:
The other side of the board contains the connection for the Sample rotor and a ribbon cable connection to the
COMB.
3.1.5 Valve boards
There are four kinds of valve board in the instrument: Valve board 1-5, Valve board 6-12, Valve board 13-18 (#13
not inserted) and Valve board 19-22.
The valve boards are connected to the controller and the driver chips are located on the PPB.

3.1.6 Peristaltic Pump
Pump generates regulated vacuum and drains the fluidic system. It is connected to the PPB and it has its own driver
circuit (Darlington). Because it is more like pneumatic unit, for more information see 2.2.8.
15 +XPDQ&RXQW Service Manual
3.1.7. Pressure Sensor
This is an MPX5100AP calibrated pressure sensor, which can measure the required air pressure and vacuum. The
Pressure Sensor is connected through a ribbon cable (not shown the picture below) to the PPB card.
The pressure sensor can operate from +5V only. It is a calibrated sensor with 0-1.1 Bar input range. Do not apply
more than 1.5 Bar to it, because it can ruin the pressure sensor.
3.1.7 Digital Reagent Sensor Board and Blood Sensor
This board contains four liquid detector opto-detectors (optos) and a reference opto for automatic temperature
and stray light compensation. The reference opto is located in the middle and it has the same temperature and
backlight conditions as the sensing ones.
Because of the special sampling method used in HUMACOUNT 5, a separate opto-detector is dedicated to the
blood sampling. This is the so-called Blood sensor and it can be seen as an external implementation of the original
board’s OPTO4 detector.
The Reagent Sensor Board is connected to the PPB card, and the valve driver micro-controller makes the sensing
and compensating operations.
Instrument makes automatic initialization – called calibration – of reagent sensors during priming phase of
fluidics.

Display assembly contains the 240x128 dots graphics LCD display and the high voltage board. LCD has a high
voltage backlight lamp (the high voltage board generates the required voltage for it).
There is a special temperature compensation circuit in the display module, which makes possible to use the LCD
module in wide temperature ranges with the adjusted contrast.
High Voltage Board (HVB) generates LCD backlight voltage (300V), aperture cleaning voltage (150V), and
measuring voltage (50V). The high voltage board is connected to the system through the amplifier board and the
COMB card. This unit contains INVC191 inverter, which is a high voltage, high frequency circuit producing suitable
voltage for CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) of the LCD.
The CFSW digital signal (from the COMB card) controls HVB: logical LOW turns inverter on. The MVON digital signal
(from the COMB card) switches the measuring voltage (50 V) on/off by OPTO switch.
Always ensure that the power is turned off when serviceing/replacing this board.
Warning! You should never service this board in active state. The high voltage (300V) at LCD lamp connector can
cause damages or electric shock.
In order to avoide possible damage to the electronic components never operate the analyzer without the LCD
backlight connected to the HVB, because the over-voltage on the output of the HVB can damage the HVB board
and the amplifier.
The LCD and Keypad controller controls the LCD display and handles the keypad (except the Start Button and Start
LED). The controller board connected to the COMB card, and communicates with the FPGA circuit through a special
serial bus.
Start Key and Status LED Board is connected to the COMB card directly (through the Display ribbon cable). The
Status LED indicates the actual status of the analyzer and it has three colors: red, green and amber (See User’s
Manual). The LED has three pins and the actual color depends on the controlled pins. Start key and status LED are
controlled by COMB.

3.2.1 Sample rotor
HUMACOUNT 5 hematology analyzer has a sample rotor for safety and more precise sample handling.
The Sample rotor unit uses a stepper motor, connected to the PPB through the XY opto board. The rotor has micro
switches for positioning.
The unit blocks itself in the home and end position with mechanical parts and has a special cap that prevents the
damage of the electronic and mechanic parts caused by any fluid.
Sample rotor is maintenance-free.
3.2.2 Sampling needle
Sampling needle is assembled in the H&V moving unit and it makes the piercing and the sample aspirations.
Correct setting of sampling needle is necessary and very important (see Chapter Adjustments).
Biohazard Warning!
Be careful, the needle is very sharp and it can cause injury!
3.2.3 Washing head
Washing head is located at the bottom of the H&V moving unit and it is for cleaning the outer surface of the
sampling needle. This washing process is made with diluent reagent and the fluid is drained by the pump. The
arrows on the picture show the direction of diluent flow during sampling needle washing.
Biohazard Warning!
Replace washing head yearly, or after 10 000 measurements.

3.2.4 H&V moving unit
This unit contains slides to move the sample sampling needle in Horizontal and Vertical directions, two stepper
motors, XYR opto board, opto wheel, washing head and the sampling needle. It moves the needle to the desired
position: from sampling position, to washing head, and to the measuring chambers.
Both stepper motors have optical end-switch sensors for detecting these positions. These are required for correct
initialization and error detection. All sensors have status LEDs to show actual conditions.
The Vertical motor works with a special opto wheel for detecting home & end positions. See the Adjustment
section of this manual to place this wheel to the proper position.
Greasing of the horizontal/vertical guiding rods should be done regularly using A598 (see sections 7, 8)
It is recommended to check and repeat greasing of guiding rods every year, or after 10000 measurements.

3.2.5 Main Dilutor
There are two stepper motors, a common motor opto board, four syringes and piston rods with gear transmission.
Maintenance should be provided to the piston tips, by applying A599 (see sections 7, 8) to the cogged end of the
Lyse, Diluent and BAS pistons, between the syringe and the tip itself. This will ensure optimum sealing and longer
lifetime of piston tips.
Greasing of the cogged transmission parts (cogwheel and cogged bar) should be done regularly using grease -
A597 (see sections 7, 8).
It is recommended to check and repeat greasing of piston tips, and transmission gear every year, or after 10000
measurements.
Important notice: for the EOS reagent we have BLACK syringe link. This different color indicates that this syringe
mustn’t be greased, because the EOS reagent will disolve the grease.

Micro dilutor is taking the precise sample (25 or 50μl) into the sampling needle. It includes a stepper motor, a
motor opto board and the micro syringe.
Flexible clutch and worm are greased using A596 (see sections 7, 8) to avoid wear of components. Re-greasing
should happen on a regular basis, after 10000 measurements, or 1 year (see section 7 for further maintenance
actions)
3.2.7 Puffer reservoir
The glass puffer reservoir is directly connected to the pressure sensor.
During measurement, there is no pump activity, so the puffer reservoir
maintains measuring vacuum 
stable. 
The instrument measures
atmospheric pressure and adjusts measuring vacuum according to it.

4 OPERATION OF THE FLUIDIC SYSTEM
This section describes the main fluidic steps of HUMACOUNT 5 measurement cycle. The instrument’s Fluidic
Schematics are shown in Section 2.2. of this manual. The following figures show total measurement flow diagram
and detailed descriptions of processes for understanding the fluidic system work.
The following steps are introduced in this section:
1. Flow diagram of measurement
2. Initialization process
3. Piercing process
4. Sampling process
5. Needle washing process
6. Diluting processes (EOS/BAS, Mix, RBC)
7. Lysing process
8. RBC counting process
9. WBC/EO/BASO counting process
10. Chamber draining process
11. Cleaning process
12. Standby process
13. Shutdown process
In the detailed process description figures, the active tube is filled with color, while an arrow () shows the
direction of the flow. Moving mechanic parts have another arrow indicating direction of movement. Some of these
processes can take place in the same time, therefore only the related valves are mentioned in each section, while
other valves may be opened (On) or closed (Off) depending on parallel processes.
In HUMACOUNT 5 the cleaning process (after measurements) and the standby process are executed in the
background. It means that the database and other functions (except pneumatic) are accessible while the analyzer
is finishing the measurement cycle (after giving the results) and while it is going to standby.
The cleaning process does not block the next measurement cycle, so after getting the results the next
measurement can be started.

After the Start Button was pressed the measurement cycle starts with the piercing process. The cleaning process of
the last measurement may be running parallel with the piercing. At first the EOS syringe aspirates 0.1 ml air into
the sampling needle. This bubble separates the diluent and the blood. After that the needle pierces the cap of the
tube, goes down to the set position and aspirates maximum 90 μl blood. The aspirated volume of blood is
depending on the existing vacuum in the tube, therefore the needle has a special “cut” to release vacuum during
aspiration.
After aspirating the needle goes up and the blood is transferred into the blood detector. If the blood can not be
sensed by the detector,  error message appears on the screen.
During the piercing process the EOS syringe moves down, V21, V19 are switched on and V20, V22 are switched off.

When sampling starts the air bubble followed by the blood is in the sampler-doser head. While the EOS syringe
transfers the blood back and forth in the sampler-doser head, the micro dilutor aspirates little bubbles and blood
samples by turns into the sampling branch. These little bubbles separate the samples, and prevent the mixing with
other fluids flowing through the sampler-doser head. The remaining blood is pushed out from the needle and from
the sampler head into the BAS/EOS MIX chamber. After that strong cleaning with diluent of these parts is
executed.
The RBC sampling follows the same method, but only one sample is taken from the MIX dilution.

The instrument cleans the sampling needle with diluent in the washing head after piercing and sampling. It is
important (especially in open tube sampling) to clean the outer surface of the sampling needle to avoid inaccurate
diluting.
The DIL syringe doses and the pump drains the diluent from the washing head, while the sampling needle moves
upwards so it is washed and cleaned. It is important to set the needle accurately for good washing.
The Macro syringe pushes the diluent through V8 (Off), V7 (On), V6 (On) (M2 dilutor motor moves upward). The
Pump aspirates the diluent from the washing head through V15 (Off), while the M2 Vertical motor moves the
sampling needle up.

4.6.1 Making EOS and BAS dilution
The sampling process has aspirated the three sample, which are in the sampling branch between the sampling-
doser head and microdilutor separated by bubbles. Before the dilution the EOS/BAS MIX chamber is rinsed with the
appropriate reagent. In this type of dilution the microdilutor doses the sample into the sampler-doser head while
the dilutor is pushing the EOS or BAS reagent into the EOS/BAS MIX chamber.
When making the EOS dilution the piston in the EOS syringe (M6 motor) moves upward and pushes the EOS
reagent through the V21 (On), V19 (On) and the sampler-doser head. Meanwhile the microdilutor is moving
upward too. The V20 and V22 valves are off during this operation.
When making the BAS dilution the piston in the BAS syringe (M3 motor) moves upward and pushes the BAS
reagent through the V22 (On), V19 (On) and the sampler-doser head. Meanwhile the microdilutor is moving
upward too. The V20 and V21 valves must be off during this operation.

4.6.2 Making MIX and RBC dilution
The last remaining sample in the sampling branch is the MIX sample. During the MIX dilution the V20 valve is
toggling (switcing on and off repeately) while the dilutor is pushing the diluent into the MIX chamber. The effect of
this method is that the diluent go through all branches of the sampler-doser head, and the blood mixed well with
the diluent quickly.
The two flow of the diluent are the following:
1. DIL syringe, V8(On), V20(Off), V19(Off), Sampler-doser head.
2. DIL syringe, V8(On), V20(On), Microdilutor, Sampler-doser head.
The RBC dilution use the same method, but the dilution is made in the RBC chamber from the RBC sample which is
came from the MIX dilution.

In this step the MIX dilution remaining in the MIX chamber flows via V3(Off), V2(On), V1(On), aspirated by the
vacuum in the puffer and the WBC chamber (V5, V11 and V14 On, V16 and V15 Off). Simultaneously the lysing
reagent is added (V14 On and Lyse syringe moves upward). This method provides good mixing and smooth lysing.
The EOS and BAS dilution transferred from the EOS/BAS MIX chamber into the WBC chamber similarly, but in this
case the V3 is off and no lyse added.

The regulated vacuum (it is generated by the pump in the puffer reservoir via V15 and V14) aspirates the diluted
sample (WBC, EOS or BAS) from the WBC chamber through the aperture (100) and V5 (On) valve while V14 is off.
The instrument counts the cells for 5 seconds in these phases (WBC/EOS/BAS). The hemoglobin measurement is
taken place before the WBC counting.

Chamber draining is made either under pressure control or under time control. Pressure controlled draining starts
with vacuum generation in the puffer reservoir. After that pump drains chamber while puffer reservoir and thus
the pressure sensor is connected to the draining tube. The instrument can detect the empty state of the chamber
from drop of vacuum. This method used mainly, except the case when the puffer used for counting and a parallel
draining is executed. In this case the chamber is drained for defined time.
4.10.1 WBC chamber draining process
The pump drains the WBC chamber through V1 (On), V2(Off), V15(On) while V16 and V11 are switched off. In
vacuum controlled mode the puffer reservoir and the pressure meter are connected to the draining tube via the
V14 (On) valve (V5 and V4 are off).

The WBC and RBC chambers are filled up with diluent (apertures are in the diluent). Then the pump aspirates the
cleaner through the V15 (On), V14 (On), V5 (On) V4(Off) V12(On) and V17 (On) valves (V1, V2, V11, V16, V18 Off) to
puffer the cleaner reagent in the tubes between V17 and V12.
After that the chambers are drained and the DIL syringe pushes the cleaner reagent remaining in the tube between
V17 and V12 into the WBC chamber and switching the V10 on pushes diluent into the RBC chamber. When the
cleaning volumes are in the chambers the apertures are cleaned by High voltage burn and back flush.
At the end of the measuring cycle the cleaning process is executed in background. It means that after giving the
results although the fluidic system is still working (performing cleaning) the database and other functions (except
pneumatic functions) are available. The next measurement can be started too by pressing the START button,
because the cleaning and the piercing process can be overlapped.
 
6WDQGE\3URFHVV
If the preset standby time is ellapsed after the last measurement, the standby process is performed. In this process
heating is disabled, chambers are rinsed with diluent and syringes are moved down.
Standby process is performed in background, so other functions can be used while the instrument is going to
standby state.

5 ADJUSTMENT
Mechanical and hardware adjustments are described in this section. Software settings are included in Section 5.2.
 
0HFKDQLFDOVHWWLQJV
There are two important mechanical settings in the system:
-
Opto wheel setting (Vertical motor)
-
Sampling needle setting
The manufacturer adjusts the analyzer during production. However, in case of repairs in the mechanical system,
these adjustments should be checked. The omission of these settings can cause malfunction or damages to the
instrument.
5.1.1 Opto wheel setting
This setting is necessary for the vertical motor movements because this adjustment sets the opto end-switches of
the H&V moving unit. The top of this block is called HV head and it is shown in the figure below.
Set the distance to 1-2 mm between the moving
carriage and the stable part of the head.
Loose „A” screws to allow free movement of the
timing belt.
Adjust the opto wheel to home position, i.e. home
hole must be in home sensor, and LED corresponding
to home opto sensor goes on.
Fasten „A” screws.
Check the end position as well: move the needle down. Adjustment is successful if end LED goes on before moving
part reaches end of mechanical range.

Once this adjustment is necessary, never miss sampling needle setting described in the next section.
48
5.1.2 Sampling needle setting
This adjustment sets the sampling needle to the operational position.
In Service menu, in Miscellaneous submenu select Needle setting.
The software moves the needle back and up, and turns on horizontal and vertical motors to keep needle in place.
Check the setting of the needle. If end of the needle is at the bottom of the washing head, needle is set correctly. If
not, open screws “B” (see above), and adjust the needle to the bottom of the washing head. Fasten “B” screws.
Set the end of the tip to the washing head’s bottom plane, while the carriage is held by motors.  (Needle setting
menu). Fix the „B” screws.
Be careful with the bent upper end of the sampling needle, because if badly aligned, during movement it can hit
other mechanical components causing mechanical jam, and therefore damages or error.
Biohazard Warning!
Be careful, the needle is very sharp and it can cause injury!

5.2.1 Amplifier offset setting
Amplifier offset should be between ±5mV. Run self
test to determine whether offset is within this range. If
it is out of range, it should be re-set, by the following
way.
1.
Locate the opening for offset 
setting
potentiometer on the measuring block (see enclosed
picture).
2.
In Service menu select Offset adjustment
menu.
3.
Adjust the potentiometer to reach 0 mV.

6.1.1 Self Test Screens
Self-test can be used to check the operation of the
instrument.
The first panel shows general information about the
instrument. (See menu on the left.)
Software version and firmware (electronics) version is
displayed on the first screen. A summary of result is
shown in the last row, turning to further pages below
will show details.
The next panels contain parameters tested, whose
meanings are listed below.
HGB light and dark (LED on/off) values. This value
classifies the hemoglobin sensor complex. Similar low
light and dark values indicate faulty sensor, low dark
light values indicate LED failure.
Electrode voltage, current and offset. Low voltage
indicates failure on HVB board, or faulty test circuit on
amplifier module. Offset can be adjusted within
service menu. Extremely high offset values indicate a
broken or disconnected shielded analog signal cable.
Amplifier transfer by generating 20000 test pulses,
incl. gain related peak value, noise related deviation.
Abnormal peak and deviation values indicate faulty
amplifier, no pulses indicate broken or disconnected
analog cable (like above)
Amplifier Noise test during a 5-second period. The lower the value, the more resistant to external noises the
system is. External noise sources (centrifuge, high power utilities, cellular phone) can generate electrical noises,
which may interfere with measurement.
Atmospheric pressure stands for outer pressure. Would this value be too low the pneumatic pressure sensor is
aged, blocked or disconnected. Checking the tubings around the pressure sensor (or valves related to the pressure
sensor or the atmospheric pressure can help as well)
Vacuum reports pump operation (vacuum made by the pump in a 10-second period of time).
Drift represents pressure loss of vacuum measured in a 10-second period of time. In case of high drift, tube
connections have to be checked.
Power ±12V shows the amplifier voltage value.

1.2.5 Service Calibration
The analyzer provides a menu for Service calibration purposes.
In result calculations the service calibration factors are used as the user calibration factors, so they are multiplied
for each parameter:
RBCDisp. = FactRBC User * FactRBC Serv. * RBCMeasured
If the user factor is near the bound (0.80- 1.20), by setting the corresponding service factor, the user factor can be
adjusted to 1.00.
Example:

1.2.6 Service menu / Settings / Software Settings
The following parameters can be adjusted in service menu:
Standby time: how many minutes instrument should wait before entering standby mode, meaning draining of
chamber, and waiting for user action. (default is 15 min).
Reblank time: how many minutes instrument should wait before making a new blank measurement after standby
mode (default = 1 hour). If set to 0, no Reblank is performed.
Rinse time: If this time is set, then instrument will make an automatic, extended washing procedure (with more
diluent) of the chamber(s) to get possible contamination out of chambers. If set to 0, no Rinse is performed.
Autoclean cycle: after how many measurements the instrument should make an auto-cleaning of critical sections
(chamber draining tubes).
Screen saver wait time: When the set time has elapsed, screen changes to displaying instrument logo, hiding
displayed information. Setting delay to 0 disables this feature.

MDA emulation mode was developed to help the manufacturer and Service Personnel in the checking phase of the
instruments. This mode is available during the total operation but especially useful for checking the BIOS setup and
OS functions. This mode should be handled the same as the service menu, the user does not have to know these
options.
At power-on, the controller PIC display module displays the greeting screen. After 6 seconds, it starts to scan the
keypad and behaves like an MDA adapter to the PC, although the displayed screen is still holding the greeting
screen.
If you switch to MDA emulation mode, the system boot events can be displayed, and the CMOS SETUP program can
be started, if necessary.
If the main program will not start in 90 seconds, the PIC will automatically switch to MDA displaying mode to give
information about the reason of hang-up. This can be some CMOS  failure, if the motherboard settings are lost for
some reason, and the system is waiting for user confirmation: F1 on external keyboard, or running setup - both
require external keyboard to be connected.
Hold the 
 button, and press and release the 
 button on the foil keyboard of the analyzer to activate the
MDA mode, which uses the LCD like a primary computer monitor (80 characters by 25 rows). The LCD is smaller
than the standard monitor area therefore just about a quarter of the total screen is displayed (40 characters by 16
rows).
-
to change the actual quarter displayed, use the
arrows (cursor keys) on the keypad,
-
to find the cursor, press the 
 button,

The analyzer checks the operations of several mechanic, fluidic and electronic parts during measurement. The
system shows the type of the error on the LCD display if any kind of malfunction is detected.
The electronic parts have a very little chance to fail, only the connections and cables could disconnect, which can
cause the malfunction of the electronic system. The mechanic and fluidic system have a bit more chance to go
wrong because it has moving parts.

Generally high count of any particle- even if you think it should be low, or near zero - can be caused by NOISE, i.e.
something interferes with measurement.
The most important thing in these cases to identify the source of NOISE, otherwise you cannot protect the system
against it.
NOISE can come from has several sources, and the different NOISE sources are added.
Sometimes we have to fight one of them, but sometimes more. Only one of them is enough to make problem.
1.9.1 Contaminated reagent
The most probable cause: real particles are in the reagent, and therefore the PLT blank is continuously high (e.g.
always 30-40). You can easily sort out this case by replacing diluent by using a fresh one. PLT blank must go down
after several blank measurements (below 10).
How can a good reagent become bad by time?
-
If the reagent tube was contaminated, and some bacteria begin to grow inside, once you put such reagent
tube into a new container it can become infected as well, i.e. the background (PLT blank) becomes high.
Wash the reagent tube - which is in connection with the reagent - with 1% of bleach solution, then rinse
with distilled water or fresh diluent.
-
If tank is open – and cap is not installed or closed - external dust can make reagent dirty.
1.9.2 Bad earth grounding
In this case external - ground referenced - noise can get into the system by ground coupling. If system ground is not
good enough, ground terminal can become a noise source as well, i.e. external signals will be coupled into the
system instead of protecting it.
If no earth ground is available, you can use a screw at the rear panel to connect a ground potential to the case, so
that noise immunity can be increased.
Measure voltage on ground terminal to make sure earth grounding is correct. AC voltage lower than 1V is accepted
in this case.
At some places - as a bad practice - electricians like to connect earth ground terminal to neutral wire. Depending on
the resistance of the neutral back wire (where it is really earthed), several volts can appear, and this way any
inductive noise will be coupled into the instrument. It is better to create a real earth grounding and connecting it to
the rear screw.
1.9.3 External electrical noise
If another instrument is near the analyzer can radiate electromagnetic signals in the 1 kHz - 100 kHz frequency
region it can be picked up by the system (especially if they are very close to each other, or the grounding is not quite
perfect).
You can easily identify this noise source: by relocating the instrument noise (high PLT blank) disappears. In this case
you have to identify the possible noise source (switch mode power supplies, computer monitors, since they are not
shielded, centrifuges due to high switching noise of rotor contacts, etc.), the power of the electromagnetic source,
because if high power is present, maybe relocation does not solve your problems, sometimes the electric power
supply makes the coupling, so UPS solves the problem.
Another source of coupling in external noise can be the reagent tanks and tubes. Especially radio transmitters can
cause problems of radiating so that even the reagents (diluent) guides in the noise. A metal pack for the diluent
tank, then a good earth grounding of this metal box allows this coupling to disappear forever.
66
1.9.4 Internal noise sources
The most annoying but real cause is some sort of internal noise. The reason for this phenomenon is that inside
electrode - hot point - of the measuring circuit must be well insulated from surrounding electronics, otherwise
inside noise sources can take their effect.

%DGFKDPEHULQVXODWLRQ
-
bad shielding of the chamber (floating shield couples signals to the chamber, and does not prevent against
them). Check grounding of shield, remove it and clean the surface between the shield and the metal base.
-
bad reference electrode connection (floating ground reference). Repair is required.
-
bad sealing of aperture. Replacement of measuring tube is required.
-
broken measuring chamber starts to conduct through the gaps (ground path). Replacement of chamber is
required.
-
contaminated draining tube starts to conduct due to protein or lipid build-up. It is very easy to identify this
case. After replacing the drain tube of the measuring chamber (mainly WBC), WBC histogram peak, or PLT
becomes low soon. Normally a good cleaner is required to dissolve lipid or protein build-up. Sometimes the
cleaner is not strong enough to keep this tube clean enough. Periodic washing using 1% hand warm bleach
solution helps.

%DGLQVXODWLRQRIHOHFWURQLFVLJQDOSDWKV
In these cases check for any capacitive coupling of electronic signals to the chamber:
-
interference with HGB head (high-frequency signal is coupled to the chamber). HGB head metal parts must
be grounded. The ground comes externally, it must be in place, otherwise HGB head does not shield, but
couples in noise.
-
interference with internal high voltage inverter (high-frequency signal is coupled to the chamber). Repair is
required: avoid near contact of HVB cable to chamber or shielded amplifier cable.
-
interference with internal start button (polling signal to start button may cause noise). Guide start button
wires as far from chamber as possible. You may try mix them up on the start micro-switch if applicable.
-
interference with display cable (high-frequency LCD signal is coupled to the chamber by the ribbon cable).
Keep the ribbon cable far from the chamber.
-
interference with CPU fan or other digital logic traces (CPU fan or other digital signal radiates to chamber or
to the shielded amplifier cable). Try keeping the ribbon cables far from the chamber and shielded cable.

%DGFRPSRQHQWVRUFRQQHFWLRQV
-
bad soldering, salt residuals or component failure on amplifier (especially if some reagent could get in the
amplifier section). Cleaning of PCB/electrode socket or replacement of amplifier is required. Check for the
correct soldering of reference cable and its connector.
-
circuit board bad soldering or component failure. Check the shielded cable connections as well. Sometimes
inside out connection (hot electrode goes outside as a shield) is the problem: both ends of amplifier signal
cable must be reversed.
-
analog signal ribbon cable (it picks up noise). Check the ribbon cable between the circuit board and the
amplifier. Maybe it is pinched under some screws or components. This may cause trouble and even noise.

3QHXPDWLFIDLOXUHVOLTXLGSDWKVWKDWFRQGXFWQRLVHLQWRWKHFKDPEHU
-
liquid remains under the chamber in drain tube (during measurement the conducting liquid remains inside
the drain tube making noise to appear there).
-
Check chamber draining path for clogging or salt crystals.
-
Check the pump operation. Since draining of the chamber goes under pressure control, maybe a bad
pressure sensor or connection can cause trouble.
-
Clean the draining path. Do not use alcohol, but bleach. Replace chamber if necessary.
-
liquid remains in the washing inlet at top of the chamber (during measurement the conducting liquid
remains inside the chamber wash tube making noise to appear). The software is not compatible with the
mechanics, or related valve is bad/partly clogged, or the tubing is clogged/loose.
-
lyse path guides in noise (if during counting the liquid in the draining tube is touching lyse reagent in T-
fitting, noise can appear). Check the lyse path, and the lyse valve as well.

The instruments should be checked and maintenance must be carried out in every 6-12 months, or after 10 000
measurement cycles.
3.3.1 Check Self test and Device statistics
Run the built-in Self test and check the overall test result. Check the device statistics to find common problems.
3.3.2 Cleaning and Greasing Dilutor Block
The dilutor block driving wheels and gear bar should be cleaned from dirt and must be greased between the gear
bar and the support, and between cogged wheels.
Use MACHINE GREASE 'LX2' FOR DILUTOR GEAR (2ml)
3.3.3 Checking and Lubricating Dilutor Piston Tips
The cogged end of PTFE dilutor pistons should be cleaned and lubricated by neutral silicon grease. Apply just a thin
layer, and move it along the perimeter of the piston, so that some of the material goes into the gaps between the
sealing rings.
Repeat this step for lyse and dilutor pistons as well. Check the condition of the micro piston sealing, and replace if
necessary.
Use SILICON GREASE FOR DILUTOR PISTONS (2ml)
DO NOT GREASE THE EOS SYRINGE PISTON TIP!!!
3.3.4 Cleaning and Lubricating Micro-dilutor mechanics
The Flexible Clutch and the motor driving axis must be lubricated to avoid wear of the precise mechanic
components. Apply grease to driving screw in upper position of micro-dilutor.
Use MACHINE GREASE 'EP(LF)2' FOR MICRODILUTOR GREAR (2ml)
3.3.5 Cleaning and Lubricating Needle Moving Mechanics
The H&V moving mechanics sliding bars should be cleaned from dust.
Use PHOTOLUBE 007 FOR SLIDING BARS (2ml)
GREASE OR PURE LUBRICATING OIL IS NOT SUITABLE.

3.3.6 Checking and Replacing Washing Head
Check the state of the washing head, and replace if necessary. After replacing washing head, do not forget to
perform correct adjustment of sampling needle height (see Section 4.1.2).
3.3.7 Checking and Replacing Peristaltic Pump Tube
Replace peristaltic pump tube if needed. You can check it by opening the lock, and removing the tube for
inspection.
Check for leakage of the tubing. Reassemble the head.
Warning! Be careful, DO NOT twist the tube while reposition it into the head, because it will cause malfunction in
a very short period of time.
3.3.8 Checking the fan
Open the instrument for regular cleaning inside. Check the cleanliness and operation of the cooling fan of the
power supply. Clean or replace the fan if necessary.

5.2.1 General Description
The analyzer is able to make serial connection link to a receiver device (e.g. computer) connected to the serial port.
If Baud Rate setting in Service Menu is set to a valid value (other than Not Connected), the instrument will try to
initiate a communication sequence.
Once the analyzer starts serial communication, the receiver should respond to it.
The hardware protocol: 8 data bit, 1 stop bit, no parity. If the other side is not responding in 1 second, the
instrument will repeat the transmission twice, but if there is still no response, the other side will be supposed to be
not ready to receive data, and thus the analyzer will not try to communicate any more.
From this state it can wake up by receiving an <ENQ> (ASCII code 5) character from the other side, and the
instrument will immediately respond an <ACK> (ASCII code 6). From this point the instrument will send data if it is
ready for transmission.
The communication is based on packages.
There are 5 package types:
-
INIT package:
Device identification, software version, current date and time.
-
DATA package:
Sample and patient information, measured parameters, and markers.
-
RBC package:
Sample information, RBC histogram.
-
WBC package:
Sample information, WBC histogram.
-
PLT package:
Sample information, PLT histogram.
The communication sequence is always started with an INIT package. If the link is successful, the instrument will
send DATA package, and the receiver can request RBC, WBC and PLT packages at acknowledge <ACK>.
Special characters used in the communication:

5.2.2 Format of Packages Sent
Packages sent by the analyzer are always between <SOH> and <EOT> characters, and they consist of header, data
and tail. The header consists of a package identifier and a package type descriptor. The tail includes the checksum.
Typical format:

MID:
Message ID, one capital letter between ’A’ and ’Z’

-
’P’
for PLT.
MESSAGE: 
the message consists of ASCII characters (between 32..128)
CHKSUM: 
two hexadecimal digits of a one-byte checksum which contains the lower byte of the
sum of characters between the <SOH> and <ETX> (incl. those, too).
5.2.3 Format of Acknowledge of the Receiver
The receiver must acknowledge transmission by the following message:
<ACK>CMD MID
CMD:
the type of the next package to send– this makes possible to a request for histograms.
If no more packages are required, <SPACE> should be sent.
MID:
the identifier of the package that acknowledged by this message.
If receiving of the message was not successful, <NAK> should be sent, and the analyzer will repeat the last package.
The receiver has approx. 1 second to reply, otherwise the analyzer will repeat the last transmission, twice
automatically. But if still no response after 3 trials, the analyzer will not start to communicate any more, even if
there is data to send (see General Description).
5.2.4 Detailed Description of Packages
The packages sent by the analyzer are placed between a header and a tail. There are 3 main types of them: INIT,
DATA and histogram packages. The histogram package can be: RBC, WBC, and PLT. The format of histograms are
the same, type descriptor differs only.

instrument is not starting a communication.
Receiver sends that it is ready to receive now, the analyzer sends acknowledge.
