Engineer: Hi, I'm seeing a flag H on the Humacount 5. What does that mean?

Chatbot: You mentioned flag H — what does it mean?
Flag H means "HGB blank is high, or no HGB blank."
You should:

Repeat the blank measurement.

If it's unstable, check for bubbles in the WBC chamber.

Run cleaning and try blank again.

Make sure the side door wasn't open during measurement.

Engineer: Got it. Now I see flag Q — what’s the fix?

Chatbot: You said you got a flag Q — what should you do?
That indicates WBC clogging.
You should:

Perform cleaning and repeat the measurement.

If the issue persists across samples, contact your service personnel.

Also ensure the reagents (especially the diluent) have reached room temperature.

Engineer: Flag b also popped up.

Chatbot: You're asking about flag 'b' — what action should be taken?
Flag 'b' means the RBC blank is high or missing.
Do the following:

Run cleaning.

Repeat the blank measurement.

If the problem persists but the values are stable, replace the diluent with a fresh tank.
⚠️ Uppercase Flags – WBC or HGB Issues

Flag: E

Meaning: No WBC 3-part differential

Recommended Action: Possible lyse problem. May occur in pathological lymphocytosis.

Flag: H

Meaning: HGB blank is high, or no HGB blank

Recommended Action:

Repeat blank measurement.

If HGB blank is unstable, check for bubbles in the WBC chamber.

Run a cleaning and try blank again.

Close the side door if it was open during measurement.

Flag: B

Meaning: WBC blank is high, or no WBC blank

Recommended Action:

Repeat blank measurement.

Run prime lyse and try blank again.

Flag: C or Q

Meaning: WBC clogging

Recommended Action:

Indicates aperture clogging.

Perform cleaning and repeat measurement.

If this is a general or recurring problem, contact your service personnel.

If reagents are cold (especially diluent), allow them to reach room temperature before proceeding.

⚠️ Lowercase Flags – RBC or PLT Issues

Flag: p

Meaning: PLT blank is high, or no PLT blank

Recommended Action:

Run cleaning and repeat blank measurement.

Check for diluent/system cleanliness.

If the issue persists but measurement is stable, replace the diluent by opening a new tank.

Flag: b

Meaning: RBC blank is high, or no RBC blank

Recommended Action:

Follow same procedure as flag 'p'.

Flag: c

Meaning: RBC/PLT clogging

Recommended Action:

Same procedure as flag 'C': clean and repeat measurement, check reagents, contact service if unresolved.



Engineer: Thanks, that helps.

Chatbot: You're welcome! If you see any more warning flags or issues, just let me know the flag letter and I’ll guide you through it.

User: I got error code 1000, what should I do?Bot: You mentioned error code 1000 — what should you do?This error means "Out of memory in %s". Fatal system or program error.Remedy: Check the COMB card and DimmPC module. Try a software upgrade.

User: What does error 1003 mean?Bot: You asked about error 1003 — what does it mean?It means the data file is corrupt. A new file will be created.Remedy: Confirm creation when prompted.

User: Error 1101 is showing.Bot: You mentioned error 1101 — what should you do?It means the waste container is full.Remedy: Empty the waste container. If not full, check for a clog in the waste sensor line.

User: What does error 1105 mean?Bot: You asked about error 1105 — what does it mean?It means "Vacuum error" due to decreased vacuum during measurement.Remedy: Check pneumatic system: pump, tubing, sensor, fittings.

User: Error 1112 appeared.Bot: You reported error 1112 — what should you do?It means the sampler rotor was jammed.Remedy: Check the adapter and tube. Press the ✓ button.

User: What does error 1201 mean?Bot: You mentioned error 1201 — what does it mean?It is a Fatal HGB error: HGB channel did not give a ready signal.Remedy: Replace the COMB board.
