Calibration Procedure are as follows
Access Calibration Menu:

Go to the Service Menu (enter access code 6484).

Select "Calibration."

Choose Parameter to Calibrate:

Options may include RBC, WBC, HGB, PLT, etc.

Enter Calibration Factors:

Use the formula:Measured Value = FactUser × FactService × Raw Value

You may adjust either User or Service factors as needed.

Apply Calibration:

Use the "Apply Calibration" option to update values.

Use "Apply User Calibration" to normalize user factors to 1.00.

Verify:

Run known control samples to verify calibration accuracy.
how to perform quality control on the Humacount 5 follow these steps:

Prepare QC Material:

Use appropriate hematology control material (e.g., low, normal, high levels).

Mix gently by inverting. Do not shake vigorously.

Run QC Samples:

Use standard sample mode.

Run each level as if it's a patient sample.

Review Results:

Compare results with expected target values and acceptable ranges provided by the control manufacturer.

Interpret & Respond:

If within range: continue routine use.

If out of range: check calibration, reagents, sample prep, or instrument function.

Document:

Record results, time, lot number, and any corrective actions.
