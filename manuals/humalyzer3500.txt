Tension Mode Measurement
In “READING ABS” screen you can monitor (after having filled water) tension coming from optical group (OPT TENS)
and tension coming in A/D converter (A/D TENS) , using a particular filter (FILTER)
Tension Mode Measurement is very useful to verify lamp calibration, filter / lamp / lens / photodiode / preamp
board quality, position sensor working.
Moreover in this screen you can test correct pump motion.
-
Press PUSH Button to aspirate distilled water
-
To select one filter use the right and left arrows: (340nm 405nm, 505nm, 546nm, 578nm and 630nm)
-
Press wheel icon, the desired filter will be placed under the light beam
-
Look at all filters TENSION values.
-
To change filter, press PUSH BUTTON if you want to fill again water.
If you have a correct calibrated optical group, when you use the flow cell, the TENSION values are between 250
mV (for 340 nm) and about 3.5 V (for 630 nm) for all filters.
14/36
Regulate trimmer R1 to obtain 3,5 V on the Tension menu (see picture bellow):

Humalyzer Hydraulic Layout:
After the complete aspiration (sample aspiration + air gap), if water stops after at beginning of aspiration tip or
stops to near the cuvette the red tube has a problem and you have to adjust aspiration by changing the aspiration
pump steps.
Aspiration regulation, proceed as follow:
1.
Enter in service menu and open Pump calibration menu.
2.
Increase “steps for 10ml” number to increase aspiration pump steps (the liquid will stop nearer to
cuvette). Use difference of +50 steps each try, then save.
3.
Decrease “steps for 10ml” number to decrease aspiration pump steps (the liquid will stop further to
cuvette). Use difference of -50 steps each try, then save.
4.
Exit from service.
5.
Enter in Run method and run glucose
6.
Prepare 500 l of water in a cuvette set the aspiration tip in a bottom angle of manual cuvette and press
